# Introduction

This is the core API for Ingresse Plarform. It should provide a set of tools to help producers run their events and
offer a better experience for their attendees.

This documentation aims to provide all the information you need to work with our API.

<aside>As you scroll, you'll see code examples for working with the API in different programming languages in the dark area to the right (or as part of the content on mobile).
You can switch the language used with the tabs at the top right (or from the nav menu at the top left on mobile).</aside>
